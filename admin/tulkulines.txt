```
for each role $r with a label containing "skye brgyud":
	for all persons $p with an event associated with $r:
	    follow incarnationOf from $p and associate them with $r
```

or in SPARQL:

```sparql
select distinct ?p ?r ?rlabel {
	{
      (?r ?sc ?rlabel) text:query ( bdo:skosLabels "\"skye brgyud\""@bo-x-ewts ) .
      ?r a bdo:Role .
    }
    ?e :personEventRole ?r .
    ?first :personEvent ?e .
    ?first :hasIncarnation* ?p .
} order by ?r
```
